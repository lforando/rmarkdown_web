### Biography

I am a current undergraduate at Smith College. I am double majoring in Psychology and Statistical and Data Sciences. I have worked as a Statistics and RStudio tutor for my college and Wyzant. I have worked in three different research labs relating to PTSD, ethics within the tech industry, and the effects of meditation on cortisol levels. I also was a Summer 2020 intern for MassMutual in their Workplace Solutions department. I will be joining Capgemini in the fall of 2021 as a Technical Consultant at their Nashville office. I also am a recipient of Smith College’s Presidential Award.

When I’m not studying, I enjoy sailing, crafting, and baking. I am also an active member on my college radio station’s executive board.
